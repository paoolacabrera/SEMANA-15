      <p  class="aboutust"> Our brow pencils contain castor oil. Nowadays thick eyebrows are trendier than ever. Look at your favourite celebrities and you’ll see most of them have dark, luscious eyebrows. Growing thicker eyebrows can be tricky, especially for those people who suffer from thinning hair and rapid brow loss. It will be tough and require a tremendous amount of patience to achieve successful growth of eyebrows. <br>
<br>
Castor oil is found to have numerous benefits especially for hair and skin. The abundance of fatty acid content makes it a perfect beauty ingredient capable of triggering hair growth. The best thing about castor oil is that it has a very high penetrative power which helps to reach the hair’s follicles and facilitate hair growth. Moreover, it’s also perfectly cheap and a natural alternative for preserving hair. It’s no wonder that it will be of great help for people who are trying to regrow their eyebrows. <br>
<br>
Buying our brow pencils will guarantee the health and growth of your brows.</p>
